abstract: >
  In this QC report a series of diagnostic plots are presented giving the reader a detailed overview of the raw file which was analyzed. This report should facitlitate the optimization of instrument methods or throubleshooting in case the results of a measurement are not as expecte. The report is focusing on MS parameters only. No direct chromatographic information is implemented as of today.

# QC

## TIC versus RT
The Total Ion Chromatogram (TIC) as well as the Base Peak plot should present a quick overview about the signal distribution over the LC-MS run. It should help to descide if the proper amount of sample was loaded and give insights about the complexity of the sample.

```{r}
try(QC <- bfabricShiny:::.calc.master.scan(rawfileQC.parameter$data.QC))
```

```{r fig.cap='Total Ion Count (TIC) and Base peak plot.'}
try(bfabricShiny:::.TIC.BasePeak(QC))

```

\newpage

## Cycle Time and points over peak

The cycle time plot should help to descide if the current instrument method is suited for the LC gradient. A too long cycle time will result in to few points over the chromatographic peaks. This is especially problematic for a quantitative experiment. A estimation of the number of Ms data points over three fixed assumed peak widths (10 sec, 20 sec, 30 sec). 

```{r fig.cap='Cycle Time plot. The plot displays the calculated time between two consecutive Ms scans. The blue horizontal line represents the 95ntil (95 % of all datapoints are below the blue line)'}
try(bfabricShiny:::.cycle.time(QC))
```

\newpage

## distribution of selected mZ values

```{r fig.cap='Time resolved distribution of selecte precursor mZ values '}
try(bfabricShiny:::.mz.dist(QC))
```

\newpage

## Precursor mass frequency

```{r fig.cap='Frequency of precursor masses for each charge state '}
try(bfabricShiny:::.mz.frequency(QC))
```

\newpage

## Frequency of precursor charge states

```{r fig.cap='Frequency of precursor charge states'}
try(bfabricShiny:::.charge.states(QC))
```

\newpage

## Cumulative precursor charges

```{r fig.cap='Cumulation of precursor charge percentages'}
try(bfabricShiny:::.charge.states.quantiles(QC))
```

\newpage

## Scan to Scan times

For HF instruments currently the scan to scan time difference is calculated. For Fusion data the "Elapsed Scan Time" value is 
plotted

```{r fig.cap='Scan to scan time difference plot'}

try(bfabricShiny:::.scan.times(QC))

```

\newpage

## Injection time plot

```{r fig.cap='Injection time plot for Ms and Ms2 scans. Blue lines indicate the max. injection time parameter'}

try(bfabricShiny:::.injection.times(QC))
```

\newpage

## MS2 cycle load

```{r fig.cap='Number of Ms2 scans between two consecutive Ms scans'}

try(bfabricShiny:::.ms2.frequency(QC))

```

\newpage

## Lock Mass correction

```{r fig.cap='lock mass correction vs RT'}

try(bfabricShiny:::.lm.correction(QC))

```

\newpage

## MS datapoints over chromatographic peak

```{r fig.cap='Displays the number of Ms data points which are recorded with the current method over three theoretical chromatographic peak width. Plot is only a help. Actual peak width needs to be checked by XIC in the raw data.'}

try(bfabricShiny:::.ms.data.points(QC))
